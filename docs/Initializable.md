**Initializable** - version: 0.1.0

This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 behind a proxy. Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {UpgradeableProxy-constructor}.
 CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.

## Contract Members
**Constants & Variables**

Indicates that the contract has been initialized.
```js
bool private _initialized;
```
---

Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.
```js
bool private _initializing;
```
